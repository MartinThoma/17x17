Filenames
---------
All files in this folder should have names like this:

WIDTH-HEIGHT-COLORS.txt

with WIDTH >= HEIGHT

Content
-------
A `WIDTH-HEIGHT-COLORS.txt` should contain exactly `HEIGHT` lines
widht `WIDTH` characters and be terminated by a `\n`.

The characters should be numbers in 0, ..., COLORS-1.
(I currently don't care about the limitation to a maximum of 10 
colors as it gets hard with 4 colors.)
